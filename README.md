# Roadmap

```
Since APP Store has already approved this APP, I'm going to re-write the media library part, which will centralize media items both from iTunes and local file.
```

- [ ] Refactor Media Library
- [ ] Update UI on Android version
- [ ] Post bug fix

# Naming in this APP

Yep, I'm a big futurama fan. Don't be scared if you found `Bender` in my source.

Also, nearly all codes were written while listening to `Kid Rock`'s `Prodigal Son`.
